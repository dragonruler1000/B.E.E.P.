# B.E.E.P.
The repository for my game B.E.E.P. (Bomb Emergency Extraction Protocol) which is being made for the jeff jam.

You’re a rookie bomb technician—and your training just ended ten seconds ago.

In B.E.E.P. (Bomb Emergency Extraction Protocol), each level throws you into a high-pressure defusal scenario where every bomb is a fast-paced logic puzzle. Cut the right wire, press the right button, decode the clues—and do it all in just 10 seconds.

No second chances. No hand-holding. Just you, the bomb, and a ticking clock.

Can you keep your cool long enough to survive the protocol?
